# shire-next-top-model

> Okay! It's time to use your newfound knowledge for a noble purpose: smacking
> around hobbits! To hit a hobbit, you’ll first model its body parts. Each body
> part will include its relative size to indicate how likely it is that that part
> will be hit. To avoid repetition, the hobbit model will include only entries for
> left foot, left ear, and so on. Therefore, you’ll need a function to fully
> symmetrize the model, creating right foot, right ear, and so forth. Finally,
> you’ll create a function that iterates over the body parts and randomly chooses
> the one hit.
